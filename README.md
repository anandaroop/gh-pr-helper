Quickie Chrome Extension hack with GitHub API

This adds a couple of missing features to GitHub's PR review UI:

- Easily collapse all diffs (This has since been [added](https://github.blog/changelog/2018-08-17-collapse-all-diffs-in-a-pull-request-at-once/) by the GitHub Paper Cuts effort)
- Get a visual indicator of where you are in a sequence of commits, and easily jump directly to another commit in the sequence.

This can be helpful in getting and keeping some global context top of mind as you make your way through a PR. Works best with the kind of PR that consists of many granular commits with descriptive commit messages.
